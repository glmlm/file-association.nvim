1. File Association                        *file-association-file-association*

**file-association.nvim** is a Lua plugin for Neovim that associates any
application with extensions and allows you to open a file directory on a
buffer. It works on a regular buffer, Netrw and other file managers.


FEATURES                          *file-association-file-association-features*

- Open the file using the string that represents the file directory on the buffer
- Open the file under the cursor in Netrw
- Create a function on the user’s side that returns the full path of the file, and use it to open the file under the cursor in other file managers, etc.


REQUIREMENTS                  *file-association-file-association-requirements*

- **Neovim** >= 0.10.0


INSTALLATION                  *file-association-file-association-installation*

Install the plugin with your package manager:


LAZY.NVIM ~

>lua
    {
      "glmlm/file-association.nvim",
      keys = {
        {
          'gX',
          '<cmd>FileAssociationOpen<CR>',
          desc = 'Open a file with user-associated application',
        },
        {
          'gy',
          '<cmd>CopyPathToClipboard<CR>',
          desc = 'Copy a filepath to the clipboard',
        },
      },
      opts = {
        ret_filepath = {
          -- NOTE: To make this plugin work on the buffer provided by your own file manager,
          -- you have to define a function that returns the full path of the file
          -- In this case, the key should be the one obtained by :lua print(vim.bo.filetype)
    
          -- Example for stevearc/oil.nvim:
          ['oil'] = function()
            local oil = require 'oil'
            local dir = oil.get_current_dir()
            local entry = oil.get_cursor_entry().name
            local filepath = dir .. entry
            return filepath
          end,
          -- Example for nvim-neo-tree/neo-tree.nvim:
          ['neo-tree'] = function()
            local state = require('neo-tree.sources.manager').get_state 'filesystem'
            local node = state.tree:get_node()
            local filepath = node:get_id()
            return filepath
          end,
        },
        exts = {
          -- NOTE: Enter the program directory as key,
          -- and the table of file extensions you want to open with it as value
    
          -- For example:
          -- ['/path/to/app'] = { 'ext' },
        },
        -- optional: You can change the file manager that opens when you select a folder directory
        -- filer = '/path/to/your_filer',
      },
    }

USAGE                                *file-association-file-association-usage*

Just type the key binding or the command :FileAssociatedOpen to open an
application that is registered according to the extension.


FAQ                                    *file-association-file-association-faq*

- Why do I need to write a function to make this plugin work with the file manager plugin’s buffer?
    - The main factor is attributed to licensing. Since each file manager plugin has its own way of getting paths, it would be necessary to exploit a dedicated API to obtain them. However, it should be noted that exploiting a third-party module could complicate the licensing of this project (GPL is a good example). To avoid such issues, this plugin allows the user to specify how to obtain the file path.
